                    This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of

            <h2>What Makes this Fried Chicken so Crispy?</h2>
            <p>There are a few reasons why this crispy fried chicken works so well.</p>
            <!-- Faq List -->
            <ul>
                <li>Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on
                    the outside and juiciness on the inside.</li>
                <li>Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however, 
                    only starts at a very high heat â€” after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn 
                    up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.</li>
                <li>Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <h3>Make the Breading</h3>
            <p>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.</p>
            <h3>Dredge the Chicken</h3>
            <p>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. 
                Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to 
                a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.</p>
            <h3>Fry the Chicken</h3>
            <p>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet,
                and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.</p>   
            <h3>Store the Chicken and/or Serve</h3>
            <p>Let the fried chicken cool before storage to prevent bacteria growth. Place it in a shallow airtight container or wrap it tightly in aluminum foil, 
                then refrigerate for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or in the oven.</p>
